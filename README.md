# How to boost my games and increase fps?
THIS METHOD DOES NOT NEED ROOT.

Overview: This tutorial will allow you to lower your android phone's resolution, relieving battery, the gpu, cpu and ram use.

# Warning! Before start
This method isn't safe in Samsung phones.
This could cause graphical issues on your launcher, your icons and other elements may seem larger or even be off screen
Use this at your own risk, I've had no major issues aside from large icons, but the trade off is a 30-40% battery boost and overall a much much smoother game (constant 60fps)

# Requirements
This requires a Windows PC or a Mac.
